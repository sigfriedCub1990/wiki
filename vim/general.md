# General

### Vim advises:

#### Learn touch-typing:

This is a very very neglected point when trying to learn **The Vim way**. I didn't realize how inefficient I was until I wanted to do **everything,** literally, with my keyboard. I wasn't so bad but I wasn't very good either so I had to practice a lot my `typing` skills to get better.

Fear not my dear fellow, it's not as hard as you may think if you have the desire to change your typing habits and learn the **correct** way of doing it.

#### Learn the VIM's language:

In order to improve your usage of **Vim** you must learn the **Vim** language. It's **imperative** because as _Donald Knuth_ once said:

> Computers are good following instructions not reading your mind.

With **Vim** is kind of the same, if you search the web for _**Vim's cheatsheet**_ I'm confident that you will find many pictures of a keyboard, no matter the layout, with **hundreds** of key combinations, this is in fact really overwhelming but you don't need that if you are starting your Vim's journey.

Learning Vim's language is a task that takes time and practice `Whole lotta of practice` as my friend Robert Plant once said :\), but fear not, as always, the more you use Vim the more comfortable you will feel **communicating** your intents to **Vim**.
