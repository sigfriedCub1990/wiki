# General

## Vim advises:

#### Learn touch-typing:

This is a very very neglected point when trying to learn **The Vim way**. I didn't realize how inefficient I was until I wanted to do **everything,** literally, with my keyboard. I wasn't so bad but I wasn't very good either so I had to practice a lot my `typing` skills to get better.

Fear not my dear fellow, it's not as hard as you may think if you have the desire to change your typing habits and learn the **correct** way of doing it.
