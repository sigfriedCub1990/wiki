# Web Workers

1. [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web\_Workers\_API)
2. [Offline cookbok](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/offline-cookbook/) (excellent guide by Jake Archibald explaining some patterns to use with Web Workers)
3. Archived [repo](https://github.com/mdn/serviceworker-cookbook) from Mozilla similar in spirit to the previous link
